Overview

This project's objective is to examine and draw conclusions from a dataset that contains data on starting pay for data analysts. These variables include job titles, employment categories, experience and expertise levels, salaries, company locations, salary currencies, salary conversions to USD, employee residences, company sizes, and years.

Methodology

The analysis used a systematic methodology that combined Excel for data cleaning and visualization with SQL for data retrieval. To begin with, the dataset's structure was analyzed in order to rectify any missing or conflicting data. Average salaries for all levels of competence were determined by descriptive research, and several Excel visualizations were created to show relevant findings. SQL queries were used to look at currency usage and geographic trends, while Excel charts and visualizations were used to display the results. Additionally, the connection between firm size and pay was studied, and past salary patterns were examined. 
After being verified, the findings were put into a thorough report with executive summaries to be sent to stakeholders. This strategy ensured meticulous and expert analysis of compensation for people with various degrees of skill, supporting data-driven decision-making.

Analysis

An organized method was used to carry out the project on examining pay for workers with various levels of competence. This approach included data extraction using SQL, data cleaning and visualization through Excel, and the creation of insightful findings. The investigation includes looking at a number of things, such as wage distributions, currency usage, regional trends, relationships between firm sizes, and salary trends through time. The study aims to provide useful insights into salary structures across expertise levels, enabling informed decision-making in the field of data analysis, by presenting the findings in a thorough report and involving stakeholders.

The relevance of these careers as often occurring and in-demand jobs for people starting their careers in data analysis is highlighted by these findings, emphasizing their importance within the data science industry.

Result two: How does the distribution of employment types vary among data science positions?  

With 3431 occurrences, "Full-Time" roles dominate the distribution of employment categories among data science positions, indicating that full-time employment is the most common option in this industry. The number of "Contract" posts, on the other hand, is somewhat low (15), while the number of "Part-Time" and "Freelance" employment is even lower (13 and 11 respectively). This distribution emphasizes a distinct preference for full-time work within the data science industry, emphasizing the stability and importance of full-time jobs in this sector.

Result three: What is the average salary for entry-level data science jobs across all experience levels?

According to the analysis, all experience levels' average starting pay for data science professionals is $201,018.53. This major finding illuminates salary expectations and possibly indicates the competitive nature of salaries within this job, serving as an essential starting point in understanding the salary structure for people entering the data science industry.

Result Four: Can you provide a breakdown of salaries by experience level?

The analysis illustrates an interesting pay distribution among data science experts according to their levels of experience. The average income for entry-level data scientists is $201,018.53, which indicates a competitive benefit package for individuals just entering the industry. Salary increases are visible as professionals advance in their professions; mid-level data scientists make, on average, $253,114.39. Senior data scientists earn an average compensation of $181,676.02 and executive-level data scientists make an average salary of $232,113.11; these figures reflect the benefits of experience and specialization in the field of data science. The relationship between experience and remuneration in the field of data science is highlighted by this wage breakdown.

Result Five: Which currency is most commonly used for salaries in this dataset, and what's the distribution of different currencies?

The United States Dollar (USD) is used as the main currency for salaries most frequently in the dataset, with 2921 instances. While USD is the most common currency, there are several others with lower occurrences in the dataset, such as the Euro (233 occurrences), British Pound Sterling (186 occurrences), Indian Rupee (46 occurrences), Canadian Dollar (31 occurrences), Australian Dollar (10 occurrences), Polish Zloty (6 occurrences), and Singapore Dollar (6 occurrences). It's important to point out that there are a lot of additional currencies in the dataset, each with fewer than 6 occurrences, illustrating a variety of currencies used by the reported salaries.

Result Six: What are the top five company locations where entry-level data science  positions are most prevalent?  

The analysis finds the top five corporate locations with the highest percentage of entry-level data science jobs. With 169 vacancies, the United States holds the top spot, demonstrating the significant demand for entry-level data science careers in this region. Following closely behind are France (10 positions), Germany (22 positions), the United Kingdom (18 positions), India (11) and Germany (22 positions). The United States is the most important market for entry-level data science workers, followed by a number of European and Asian nations. These findings show the geographical spread of opportunities for these professionals.




Result Seven: Is there any noticeable difference in average salaries for entry data science when converted to USD across different company locations?

Significant differences in average earnings when converted to US dollars are visible among the top three corporate locations for entry-level data science positions. The average pay in the United States is $99,763.06; Kenya's average salary is $50,000; and the United Kingdom's average salary is $62,732.72. These results demonstrate the wide geographic disparity in pay for entry-level data science jobs, with the United States paying the highest salaries, followed by Kenya and the United Kingdom.


Result eight: Can you identify any correlation between the size of the company and the salaries offered to entry-level data science roles?

The study finds a relationship between the company's size and the starting pay for data science specialists.

These results show a discernible decline in average salary for entry-level data science jobs, pointing to a potential change in market dynamics or outside influences on pay in the industry. To comprehend the underlying causes of this tendency, additional research and context analysis may be required.
Conclusion
 
As a result of our analysis of data science positions, several important conclusions have been drawn. First, "Data Engineer" is the most common job title among entry-level data science workers, according to our analysis. Second, the major currency for salaries in the dataset is the United States Dollar (USD). The United States, followed by the United Kingdom and Kenya, has the highest average income among the top three corporate destinations for entry-level data science positions. Additionally, we found a link between company size and entry-level data scientist salaries, with larger businesses typically paying more. Last but not least, we have observed an interesting pattern in the average earnings for entry-level data science positions, with salaries significantly declining from 2020 to 2023. 

Together, these results emphasize the dynamic and changing nature of entry-level data science positions, which include a range of job titles, currency preferences, geographic salary differences, effects of firm size, and observable salary changes over time. These revelations offer important context for individuals and businesses working in the data science sector and highlight potential research and analysis topics.
